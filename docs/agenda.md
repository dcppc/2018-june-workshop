The 2018 June DCPPC workshop will take place 
on **June 29-30 in Portland, Oregon** 
concurrent with the [GCC BOSC 2018 Conference](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/). 
Both GCC BOSC and the DCPPC Workshop will be held at 
[Reed College](http://www.reed.edu/)
in Portland.

## Concurrent Workshop and Hackathon

Team Copper is planning the monthly meeting and Teams Helium, Argon, Calcium, and Xenon are planning a 2-day hackathon. These events will run concurrently.
To maximize the efficacy of both events, all participants will come together at the welcome remarks, end of the day recaps, closing remarks, coffee breaks, and lunch as described in the workshop schedule below. Then, attendees can split off into whatever is most useful for them and for the DCPPC (hackathon only, hackathon in lieu of the breakout sessions, workshop only).

2. **DOS+BDBags:** What is the relationship between the DOS API and BDBags as interoperable data access and exchange standards?
3. **Auth:** Working implementations of REST APIs supporting the OAuth/OIDC federation model.

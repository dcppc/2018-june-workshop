The 2018 June DCPPC workshop will take place 
on **June 29-30 in Portland, Oregon** 
concurrent with the [GCC BOSC 2018 Conference](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/). 
Both GCC BOSC and the DCPPC Workshop will be held at 
[Reed College](http://www.reed.edu/)
in Portland.

## Concurrent Collaboration Fest, DCPPC Workshops, and DCPPC Hackathon

[Collaboration Fest](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gccbosc2018/collaboration/) includes multiple tracks including the Data Commons Pilot Phase Consortium (DCPPC), OpenBio Codefest (OBF), Galaxy development, and Galaxy documentation, analysis, and training (DAT). We will be sharing spaces will all these events and you are encouraged to network!

Additionally, the DCPPC will have two concurrent tracks: main workshop and hackathon. Team Copper is planning the monthly meeting and Teams Helium, Argon, Calcium, and Xenon are planning a 2-day hackathon. These events will run concurrently. To maximize the efficacy of both events, all participants will come together at the welcome remarks, end of the day recaps, closing remarks, coffee breaks, and lunch as described in the workshop schedule below. Then, attendees can split off into whatever is most useful for them and for the DCPPC (hackathon only, hackathon in lieu of the breakout sessions, workshop only). 

Check out this infographic from Sarah Davis for an overview.

_Hackers should plan on attending the Workshop Welcome each morning at 9 am. We can play it by ear how many of the Lightning Talks to attend. At the end of each day, hackers should be prepared to give a very brief update on what was accomplished in the hackathon._

The hackathon will focus on three themes:

1. **Workflows:** Creating reusable validations tools to assess whether or not different implementations of a workflow are producing the expected results.
2. **DOS+BDBags:** What is the relationship between the DOS API and BDBags as interoperable data access and exchange standards?
3. **Auth:** Working implementations of REST APIs supporting the OAuth/OIDC federation model.
